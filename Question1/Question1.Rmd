References are to be made as follows: @fama1997[p. 33] and @grinold2000 Such authors could also be referenced in brackets [@grinold2000] and together [@fama1997 \& @grinold2000]. Source the reference code from scholar.google.com by clicking on ``cite'' below article name. Then select BibTeX at the bottom of the Cite window, and proceed to copy and paste this code into your ref.bib file, located in the directory's Tex folder. Open this file in Rstudio for ease of management, else open it in your preferred Tex environment. Add and manage your article details here for simplicity - once saved, it will self-adjust in your paper.

> I suggest renaming the top line after \@article, as done in the template ref.bib file, to something more intuitive for you to remember. Do not change the rest of the code. Also, be mindful of the fact that bib references from google scholar may at times be incorrect. Reference Latex forums for correct bibtex notation.

<!-- The following is a code chunk. It must have its own unique name (after the r), or no name. After the comma follows commands for R which are self-explanatory. By default, the code and messages will not be printed in your pdf, just the output: -->

```{r Figure1,  warning =  FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "BRICS country differences \\label{Figure1}", fig.ext = 'png', fig.height = 5, fig.width = 6}
BRICS_insights(BRICS)
```

For BRICS countries, South Africa experienced the largest mortality rate of people infected with covid. Brazil and Russia are not far behind though. However, Brazil and Russia have more of their population vaccinated which would explain why their mortality rates are lower. Data for China was largely unavailable. 

```{r Figure2, warning =  FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "African country differences \\label{Figure2}", fig.height = 5, fig.width = 6, fig.ext = 'png'}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 5, fig.pos="H", fig.pos = 'H')
africa_insights(africa)
```

As can be seen in Figure \ref{Figure2}, Botswana had a very high proportion of its population infected with Covid but its mortality rate was low.  South Africa has the highest mortality rate amongst all African countries that border or are close to South Africa. Namibia is a close second. The populations of Madagascar, Mozambique and Zimbabwe all have the best chance of survival had they contracted Covid.

  theme(text = element_text(size=7))
```
Countries with a lower average life expectancy experienced a high mortality rate had a person contracted Covid.

```{r Figure4, warning =  FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Female smokers \\label{Figure4}", fig.height = 5, fig.width = 6, fig.ext = 'png'}
ggplot(merged_female_smokers1, aes(x = female_smokers, y = Value, fill = Variable))+
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  geom_text(aes(label = Value), size = 2, vjust = 1.5, position = position_dodge(.9)) +
  theme(text = element_text(size=7))
```
Female smokers seem to be able to survive Covid more than non-smokers or non-heavy smokers. This is peculiar. 

```{r Figure5, warning =  FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Male smokers \\label{Figure5}", fig.height = 5, fig.width = 6, fig.ext = 'png'}
ggplot(merged_male_smokers1, aes(x = male_smokers, y = Value, fill = Variable))+
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  geom_text(aes(label = Value), size = 2, vjust = 1.5, position = position_dodge(.9)) +
  theme(text = element_text(size=7))
```
Male smokers on the other hand tended to have an increased mortality rate if Covid was contracted. 

```{r Figure6, warning =  FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Elderly \\label{Figure6}", fig.height = 5, fig.width = 6, fig.ext = 'png'}
ggplot(merged_elderly1, aes(x = aged_65_older, y = Value, fill = Variable))+
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  geom_text(aes(label = Value), size = 2, vjust = 1.5, position = position_dodge(.9)) +
  theme(text = element_text(size=7))
```
An individual that is very young and contracts Covid is more likely to die than an individual that is old and contracts Covid. 

```{r Figure7, warning =  FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Hospital beds \\label{Figure7}", fig.height = 5, fig.width = 6, fig.ext = 'png'}
ggplot(merged_hospitalbeds1, aes(x = hospital_beds_per_thousand, y = Value, fill = Variable))+
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  geom_text(aes(label = Value), size = 2, vjust = 1.5, position = position_dodge(.9)) +
  theme(text = element_text(size=7))
```
This result is perplexing. It seems as if having more hospital beds available to the population correlates to a higher change of death for individuals with Covid. This could be the result of government increasing hospital capacity to accommodate an influx of infected individuals. 

```{r Figure8, warning =  FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Handwashing facilities \\label{Figure8}", fig.height = 5, fig.width = 6, fig.ext = 'png'}
ggplot(merged_handwashing1, aes(x = handwashing_facilities, y = Value, fill = Variable))+
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  geom_text(aes(label = Value), size = 2, vjust = 1.5, position = position_dodge(.9)) +
  theme(text = element_text(size=7))
```
It seems as though handwashing facilities do not have much of an impact on the mortality rate of individuals.

# Conclusion

The Covid pandemic wrecked havoc globally. The mortality rate of many countries increased due to the virus. Country's whose population do not lead healthy lives are more likely to die from contracting Covid.
