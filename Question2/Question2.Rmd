<!-- First: Set your default preferences for chunk options: -->

<!-- If you want a chunk's code to be printed, set echo = TRUE. message = FALSE stops R printing ugly package loading details in your final paper too. I also suggest setting warning = FALSE and checking for warnings in R, else you might find ugly warnings in your paper. -->

# warning and message = FALSE implies ugly messages and warnings are removed from your pdf.

# Introduction \label{Introduction}

The weather in London over the period 1979 through 2020 was analysed. I, the author, am to be of the opinion that the weather in London is not as enjoyable as my female classmate thinks it is. Having analysed the data, the weather in London could be said to be fair. London, on average, experiences neither great weather nor terrible weather. 


> Figures \ref{Figure1}, \ref{Figure2}, \ref{Figure3} and \ref{Figure4} make an attempt at finding out which months of the year are characterized by different weather patterns. It is noted that the months of June through September are arguably the most enjoyable months in London. 







```{r cloud cover, include = FALSE}
library("lubridate")
london_weather[ , 1] <- ymd(london_weather[, 1])

monthlycloudcover <- function(data1=data1){
    library(data.table)
    January <- data1 |> filter(month(date) == 1) |> select(,c(date,cloud_cover))
    Jan <- mean(January[,2], na.rm = TRUE)
    Febuary <- data1 |> filter(month(date) == 2) |> select(,c(date,cloud_cover))
    Feb <- mean(Febuary[,2], na.rm = TRUE)
    March <- data1 |> filter(month(date) == 3) |> select(,c(date,cloud_cover))
    Mar <- mean(March[,2], na.rm = TRUE)
    April <- data1 |> filter(month(date) == 4) |> select(,c(date,cloud_cover))
    Apr <- mean(April[,2], na.rm = TRUE)
    May <- data1 |> filter(month(date) == 5) |> select(,c(date,cloud_cover))
    May <- mean(May[,2], na.rm = TRUE)
    June <- data1 |> filter(month(date) == 6) |> select(,c(date,cloud_cover))
    Jun <- mean(June[,2], na.rm = TRUE)
    July <- data1 |> filter(month(date) == 7) |> select(,c(date,cloud_cover))
    Jul <- mean(July[,2], na.rm = TRUE)
    August <- data1 |> filter(month(date) == 8) |> select(,c(date,cloud_cover))
    Aug <- mean(August[,2], na.rm = TRUE)
    September <- data1 |> filter(month(date) == 9) |> select(,c(date,cloud_cover))
    Sep <- mean(September[,2], na.rm = TRUE)
    October <- data1 |> filter(month(date) == 10) |> select(,c(date,cloud_cover))
    Oct <- mean(October[,2], na.rm = TRUE)
    November <- data1 |> filter(month(date) == 11) |> select(,c(date,cloud_cover))
    Nov <- mean(November[,2], na.rm = TRUE)
    December <- data1 |> filter(month(date) == 12) |> select(,c(date,cloud_cover))
    Dec <- mean(December[,2], na.rm = TRUE)
    df <- rbind(Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec)
    df1 <- as.data.frame(df)
    setDT(df1, keep.rownames = "Month")[]
    ggplot(df1, aes(x = Month, y = V1)) +
        geom_point() +
        labs(y = "Cloud Cover", title = "Average cloud cover in London")
}
```



<!-- The following is a code chunk. It must have its own unique name (after the r), or no name. After the comma follows commands for R which are self-explanatory. By default, the code and messages will not be printed in your pdf, just the output: -->

```{r Figure1,  warning =  FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Cloud cover \\label{Figure1}", fig.ext = 'png', fig.height = 3, fig.width = 6}
monthlycloudcover(data1 = london_weather)
```

As can be seen in \ref{Figure1}, cloud cover is the least during the months of August and September. July and April are not far behind in this regard. I consider less cloud cover to be an indicator of good weather. 

```{r sunshine, include = FALSE}
monthlysunshine <- function(data1=data1){
    library(data.table)
    January <- data1 |> filter(month(date) == 1) |> select(,c(date,sunshine))
    Jan <- mean(January[,2], na.rm = TRUE)
    Febuary <- data1 |> filter(month(date) == 2) |> select(,c(date,sunshine))
    Feb <- mean(Febuary[,2], na.rm = TRUE)
    March <- data1 |> filter(month(date) == 3) |> select(,c(date,sunshine))
    Mar <- mean(March[,2], na.rm = TRUE)
    April <- data1 |> filter(month(date) == 4) |> select(,c(date,sunshine))
    Apr <- mean(April[,2], na.rm = TRUE)
    May <- data1 |> filter(month(date) == 5) |> select(,c(date,sunshine))
    May <- mean(May[,2], na.rm = TRUE)
    June <- data1 |> filter(month(date) == 6) |> select(,c(date,sunshine))
    Jun <- mean(June[,2], na.rm = TRUE)
    July <- data1 |> filter(month(date) == 7) |> select(,c(date,sunshine))
    Jul <- mean(July[,2], na.rm = TRUE)
    August <- data1 |> filter(month(date) == 8) |> select(,c(date,sunshine))
    Aug <- mean(August[,2], na.rm = TRUE)
    September <- data1 |> filter(month(date) == 9) |> select(,c(date,sunshine))
    Sep <- mean(September[,2], na.rm = TRUE)
    October <- data1 |> filter(month(date) == 10) |> select(,c(date,sunshine))
    Oct <- mean(October[,2], na.rm = TRUE)
    November <- data1 |> filter(month(date) == 11) |> select(,c(date,sunshine))
    Nov <- mean(November[,2], na.rm = TRUE)
    December <- data1 |> filter(month(date) == 12) |> select(,c(date,sunshine))
    Dec <- mean(December[,2], na.rm = TRUE)
    df <- rbind(Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec)
    df1 <- as.data.frame(df)
    setDT(df1, keep.rownames = "Month")[]
    ggplot(df1, aes(x = Month, y = V1)) +
        geom_point() +
        labs(y = "Sunshine", title = "Mean sunshine in London")
}
```


```{r Figure2, warning =  FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Sunshine \\label{Figure2}", fig.height = 3, fig.width = 6, fig.ext = 'png'}
monthlysunshine(data1 = london_weather)
```

As can be seen in \ref{Figure2}, the months of June and July experience the most amount of sunshine. May and August follow closely behind. I consider more sunshine to be an indicator of good weather. The early and late parts of each year tend to experience less sunshine on average.

```{r mean temperature, include=FALSE}
monthlymeantemp <- function(data1=data1){
    library(data.table)
    January <- data1 |> filter(month(date) == 1) |> select(,c(date,mean_temp))
    Jan <- mean(January[,2], na.rm = TRUE)
    Febuary <- data1 |> filter(month(date) == 2) |> select(,c(date,mean_temp))
    Feb <- mean(Febuary[,2], na.rm = TRUE)
    March <- data1 |> filter(month(date) == 3) |> select(,c(date,mean_temp))
    Mar <- mean(March[,2], na.rm = TRUE)
    April <- data1 |> filter(month(date) == 4) |> select(,c(date,mean_temp))
    Apr <- mean(April[,2], na.rm = TRUE)
    May <- data1 |> filter(month(date) == 5) |> select(,c(date,mean_temp))
    May <- mean(May[,2], na.rm = TRUE)
    June <- data1 |> filter(month(date) == 6) |> select(,c(date,mean_temp))
    Jun <- mean(June[,2], na.rm = TRUE)
    July <- data1 |> filter(month(date) == 7) |> select(,c(date,mean_temp))
    Jul <- mean(July[,2], na.rm = TRUE)
    August <- data1 |> filter(month(date) == 8) |> select(,c(date,mean_temp))
    Aug <- mean(August[,2], na.rm = TRUE)
    September <- data1 |> filter(month(date) == 9) |> select(,c(date,mean_temp))
    Sep <- mean(September[,2], na.rm = TRUE)
    October <- data1 |> filter(month(date) == 10) |> select(,c(date,mean_temp))
    Oct <- mean(October[,2], na.rm = TRUE)
    November <- data1 |> filter(month(date) == 11) |> select(,c(date,mean_temp))
    Nov <- mean(November[,2], na.rm = TRUE)
    December <- data1 |> filter(month(date) == 12) |> select(,c(date,mean_temp))
    Dec <- mean(December[,2], na.rm = TRUE)
    df <- rbind(Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec)
    df1 <- as.data.frame(df)
    setDT(df1, keep.rownames = "Month")[]
    ggplot(df1, aes(x = Month, y = V1)) +
        geom_point() +
        labs(y = "Mean Temperature", title = "Mean temperature in London")
}
```

```{r Figure3, warning =  FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Mean temperature \\label{Figure3}", fig.height = 3, fig.width = 6, fig.ext = 'png'}
monthlymeantemp(data1 = london_weather)
```

As can be seen in \ref{Figure3}, the months of August and July experience the hottest average temperatures. June and September follow closely behind. The hottest month, on average, barely reaches 20 degrees. In comparison to South Africa, London is a cold place to live. 

```{r precipitation, include=FALSE}
monthlyprecipitation <- function(data1=data1){
    library(data.table)
    January <- data1 |> filter(month(date) == 1) |> select(,c(date,precipitation))
    Jan <- mean(January[,2], na.rm = TRUE)
    Febuary <- data1 |> filter(month(date) == 2) |> select(,c(date,precipitation))
    Feb <- mean(Febuary[,2], na.rm = TRUE)
    March <- data1 |> filter(month(date) == 3) |> select(,c(date,precipitation))
    Mar <- mean(March[,2], na.rm = TRUE)
    April <- data1 |> filter(month(date) == 4) |> select(,c(date,precipitation))
    Apr <- mean(April[,2], na.rm = TRUE)
    May <- data1 |> filter(month(date) == 5) |> select(,c(date,precipitation))
    May <- mean(May[,2], na.rm = TRUE)
    June <- data1 |> filter(month(date) == 6) |> select(,c(date,precipitation))
    Jun <- mean(June[,2], na.rm = TRUE)
    July <- data1 |> filter(month(date) == 7) |> select(,c(date,precipitation))
    Jul <- mean(July[,2], na.rm = TRUE)
    August <- data1 |> filter(month(date) == 8) |> select(,c(date,precipitation))
    Aug <- mean(August[,2], na.rm = TRUE)
    September <- data1 |> filter(month(date) == 9) |> select(,c(date,precipitation))
    Sep <- mean(September[,2], na.rm = TRUE)
    October <- data1 |> filter(month(date) == 10) |> select(,c(date,precipitation))
    Oct <- mean(October[,2], na.rm = TRUE)
    November <- data1 |> filter(month(date) == 11) |> select(,c(date,precipitation))
    Nov <- mean(November[,2], na.rm = TRUE)
    December <- data1 |> filter(month(date) == 12) |> select(,c(date,precipitation))
    Dec <- mean(December[,2], na.rm = TRUE)
    df <- rbind(Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec)
    df1 <- as.data.frame(df)
    setDT(df1, keep.rownames = "Month")[]
    ggplot(df1, aes(x = Month, y = V1)) +
        geom_point() +
        labs(y = "Precipitation", title = "Average precipitation in London")
}
```

```{r Figure4, warning =  FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Mean precipitation \\label{Figure4}", fig.height = 3, fig.width = 6, fig.ext = 'png'}
monthlyprecipitation(data1 = london_weather)
```

As can be seen in \ref{Figure4}, the months of October and November experience the most average precipitation. December and January follow closely behind. It seems as though it is highly likely to a person living in London will experience during all months throughout the year. That is not to say that it is continuous rain though.

```{r ShortTable, results = 'asis'}
Avecloudcover <- monthlycloudcover_table(data1 = london_weather)
Avesunshine <- monthlysunshine_table(data1 = london_weather)
Avemeantemp <- monthlymeantemp_table(data1 = london_weather)
Aveprecipitation <- monthlyprecipitation_table(data1 = london_weather)

library(xtable)
data <- data.frame(Avecloudcover, Avesunshine, Avemeantemp, Aveprecipitation)
table <- xtable(data, caption = "Average values throughout the year \\label{tab1}")
  print.xtable(table,
             # tabular.environment = "longtable",
             floating = TRUE,
             table.placement = 'H',
             # scalebox = 0.3,
             comment = FALSE,
             caption.placement = 'bottom'
             )
```

The yearly average of each factor can be seen in \ref{tab1}. London is not a hot place to live as the city averages roughly 11.44 degrees throughout the year. Cloud cover seems to be reasonably high as well. As aforementioned, it is likely to rain every month of the year in London but is is also likely to be reasonably sunny.

# Conclusion

A persons preference for weather types is highly subjective. My personal preference is toward a warm climate with sporadic rainfall. London has a modest climate with frequent rainfall. All in all, the weather is not awful and it is not mostly sunny nor mostly cold or rainy. The weather is modest but is slightly more characterized by bad weather than good weather.
