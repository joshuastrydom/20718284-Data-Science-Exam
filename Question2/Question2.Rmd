<!-- First: Set your default preferences for chunk options: -->

<!-- If you want a chunk's code to be printed, set echo = TRUE. message = FALSE stops R printing ugly package loading details in your final paper too. I also suggest setting warning = FALSE and checking for warnings in R, else you might find ugly warnings in your paper. -->

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 5, fig.pos="H", fig.pos = 'H')
# Note: Include = FALSE implies the code is executed, but not printed in your pdf.
# warning and message = FALSE implies ugly messages and warnings are removed from your pdf.
# These should be picked up when you execute the command chunks (code sections below) in your rmd, not printed in your paper!

# Lets load in example data, and see how this can be stored and later called from your 'data' folder.

# Introduction \label{Introduction}

The weather in London over the period 1979 through 2020 was analysed. I, the author, am to be of the opinion that the weather in London is not as enjoyable as my female classmate thinks it is. 


> Figures \ref{Figure1}, \ref{Figure2}, \ref{Figure3} and \ref{Figure4} make an attempt at finding out which months of the year are characterized by different weather patterns. It is noted that the months of June through September are arguably the most enjoyable months. 







```{r cloud cover, include = FALSE}
library("lubridate")
london_weather[ , 1] <- ymd(london_weather[, 1])

monthlycloudcover <- function(data1=data1){
    library(data.table)
    January <- data1 |> filter(month(date) == 1) |> select(,c(date,cloud_cover))
    Jan <- mean(January[,2], na.rm = TRUE)
    Febuary <- data1 |> filter(month(date) == 2) |> select(,c(date,cloud_cover))
    Feb <- mean(Febuary[,2], na.rm = TRUE)
    March <- data1 |> filter(month(date) == 3) |> select(,c(date,cloud_cover))
    Mar <- mean(March[,2], na.rm = TRUE)
    April <- data1 |> filter(month(date) == 4) |> select(,c(date,cloud_cover))
    Apr <- mean(April[,2], na.rm = TRUE)
    May <- data1 |> filter(month(date) == 5) |> select(,c(date,cloud_cover))
    May <- mean(May[,2], na.rm = TRUE)
    June <- data1 |> filter(month(date) == 6) |> select(,c(date,cloud_cover))
    Jun <- mean(June[,2], na.rm = TRUE)
    July <- data1 |> filter(month(date) == 7) |> select(,c(date,cloud_cover))
    Jul <- mean(July[,2], na.rm = TRUE)
    August <- data1 |> filter(month(date) == 8) |> select(,c(date,cloud_cover))
    Aug <- mean(August[,2], na.rm = TRUE)
    September <- data1 |> filter(month(date) == 9) |> select(,c(date,cloud_cover))
    Sep <- mean(September[,2], na.rm = TRUE)
    October <- data1 |> filter(month(date) == 10) |> select(,c(date,cloud_cover))
    Oct <- mean(October[,2], na.rm = TRUE)
    November <- data1 |> filter(month(date) == 11) |> select(,c(date,cloud_cover))
    Nov <- mean(November[,2], na.rm = TRUE)
    December <- data1 |> filter(month(date) == 12) |> select(,c(date,cloud_cover))
    Dec <- mean(December[,2], na.rm = TRUE)
    df <- rbind(Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec)
    df1 <- as.data.frame(df)
    setDT(df1, keep.rownames = "Month")[]
    ggplot(df1, aes(x = Month, y = V1)) +
        geom_point() +
        labs(y = "Cloud Cover", title = "Average cloud cover in London")
}
```



<!-- The following is a code chunk. It must have its own unique name (after the r), or no name. After the comma follows commands for R which are self-explanatory. By default, the code and messages will not be printed in your pdf, just the output: -->

```{r Figure1,  warning =  FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Cloud cover \\label{Figure1}", fig.ext = 'png', fig.height = 3, fig.width = 6}
monthlycloudcover(data1 = london_weather)
```

As can be seen in \ref{Figure1}, cloud cover is the least during the months of August and September. July and April are not far behind in this regard. I consider less cloud cover to be an indicator of good weather. 

```{r sunshine, include = FALSE}
monthlysunshine <- function(data1=data1){
    library(data.table)
    January <- data1 |> filter(month(date) == 1) |> select(,c(date,sunshine))
    Jan <- mean(January[,2], na.rm = TRUE)
    Febuary <- data1 |> filter(month(date) == 2) |> select(,c(date,sunshine))
    Feb <- mean(Febuary[,2], na.rm = TRUE)
    March <- data1 |> filter(month(date) == 3) |> select(,c(date,sunshine))
    Mar <- mean(March[,2], na.rm = TRUE)
    April <- data1 |> filter(month(date) == 4) |> select(,c(date,sunshine))
    Apr <- mean(April[,2], na.rm = TRUE)
    May <- data1 |> filter(month(date) == 5) |> select(,c(date,sunshine))
    May <- mean(May[,2], na.rm = TRUE)
    June <- data1 |> filter(month(date) == 6) |> select(,c(date,sunshine))
    Jun <- mean(June[,2], na.rm = TRUE)
    July <- data1 |> filter(month(date) == 7) |> select(,c(date,sunshine))
    Jul <- mean(July[,2], na.rm = TRUE)
    August <- data1 |> filter(month(date) == 8) |> select(,c(date,sunshine))
    Aug <- mean(August[,2], na.rm = TRUE)
    September <- data1 |> filter(month(date) == 9) |> select(,c(date,sunshine))
    Sep <- mean(September[,2], na.rm = TRUE)
    October <- data1 |> filter(month(date) == 10) |> select(,c(date,sunshine))
    Oct <- mean(October[,2], na.rm = TRUE)
    November <- data1 |> filter(month(date) == 11) |> select(,c(date,sunshine))
    Nov <- mean(November[,2], na.rm = TRUE)
    December <- data1 |> filter(month(date) == 12) |> select(,c(date,sunshine))
    Dec <- mean(December[,2], na.rm = TRUE)
    df <- rbind(Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec)
    df1 <- as.data.frame(df)
    setDT(df1, keep.rownames = "Month")[]
    ggplot(df1, aes(x = Month, y = V1)) +
        geom_point() +
        labs(y = "Sunshine", title = "Mean sunshine in London")
}
```


```{r Figure2, warning =  FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Sunshine \\label{Figure2}", fig.height = 3, fig.width = 6, fig.ext = 'png'}
monthlysunshine(data1 = london_weather)
```

As can be seen in \ref{Figure2}, the months of June and July experience the most amount of sunshine. May and August follow closely behind. 

```{r mean temperature, include=FALSE}
monthlymeantemp <- function(data1=data1){
    library(data.table)
    January <- data1 |> filter(month(date) == 1) |> select(,c(date,mean_temp))
    Jan <- mean(January[,2], na.rm = TRUE)
    Febuary <- data1 |> filter(month(date) == 2) |> select(,c(date,mean_temp))
    Feb <- mean(Febuary[,2], na.rm = TRUE)
    March <- data1 |> filter(month(date) == 3) |> select(,c(date,mean_temp))
    Mar <- mean(March[,2], na.rm = TRUE)
    April <- data1 |> filter(month(date) == 4) |> select(,c(date,mean_temp))
    Apr <- mean(April[,2], na.rm = TRUE)
    May <- data1 |> filter(month(date) == 5) |> select(,c(date,mean_temp))
    May <- mean(May[,2], na.rm = TRUE)
    June <- data1 |> filter(month(date) == 6) |> select(,c(date,mean_temp))
    Jun <- mean(June[,2], na.rm = TRUE)
    July <- data1 |> filter(month(date) == 7) |> select(,c(date,mean_temp))
    Jul <- mean(July[,2], na.rm = TRUE)
    August <- data1 |> filter(month(date) == 8) |> select(,c(date,mean_temp))
    Aug <- mean(August[,2], na.rm = TRUE)
    September <- data1 |> filter(month(date) == 9) |> select(,c(date,mean_temp))
    Sep <- mean(September[,2], na.rm = TRUE)
    October <- data1 |> filter(month(date) == 10) |> select(,c(date,mean_temp))
    Oct <- mean(October[,2], na.rm = TRUE)
    November <- data1 |> filter(month(date) == 11) |> select(,c(date,mean_temp))
    Nov <- mean(November[,2], na.rm = TRUE)
    December <- data1 |> filter(month(date) == 12) |> select(,c(date,mean_temp))
    Dec <- mean(December[,2], na.rm = TRUE)
    df <- rbind(Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec)
    df1 <- as.data.frame(df)
    setDT(df1, keep.rownames = "Month")[]
    ggplot(df1, aes(x = Month, y = V1)) +
        geom_point() +
        labs(y = "Mean Temperature", title = "Mean temperature in London")
}
```

```{r Figure3, warning =  FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Mean temperature \\label{Figure3}", fig.height = 3, fig.width = 6, fig.ext = 'png'}
monthlymeantemp(data1 = london_weather)
```

As can be seen in \ref{Figure3}, the months of August and July experience the hottest average temperatures. June and September follow closely behind. 

```{r precipitation, include=FALSE}
monthlyprecipitation <- function(data1=data1){
    library(data.table)
    January <- data1 |> filter(month(date) == 1) |> select(,c(date,precipitation))
    Jan <- mean(January[,2], na.rm = TRUE)

    Feb <- mean(Febuary[,2], na.rm = TRUE)

    Mar <- mean(March[,2], na.rm = TRUE)

```

```{r Figure4, warning =  FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Mean precipitation \\label{Figure4}", fig.height = 3, fig.width = 6, fig.ext = 'png'}
monthlyprecipitation(data1 = london_weather)
```

As can be seen in \ref{Figure4}, the months of October and November experience the most average precipitation. December and January follow closely behind.
